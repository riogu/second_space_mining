if you want to build this project:
- create a build/ directory in the main folder
- probably make an assets/ directory just in case (probably not necessary)
- run "start_project.sh" from the root directory 'bash start_project.sh'

regarding dependencies:
- raylib is the only dependency in this project (and C/C++ 20) (i think im using C++23 but anyways lol)
- i think you dont need anything besides a c++ compiler to get this code working
